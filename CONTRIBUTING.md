# How to contribute

Contributing to PoshSec is a great way to give back to the community. We accept pull requests from anyone who submits one. There are a few guidelines, however, that a new pull request must adhere to before it is merged.

## Adding functionality.

New features for PoshSec are added as individual .ps1 files and are grouped into the appropriate submodule of the main PoshSec module. A list of modules can be found in the [PoshSec Wiki](https://github.com/PoshSec/PoshSec/wiki). Adding additional modules is possible but before you submit a pull request, add an issue for feedback from the maintainers. If you want immediate feedback, you can tweet Matt Johnson (@mwjcomputing) and ask the question on there.
